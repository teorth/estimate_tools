I am experimenting with ways to use computer assistance to help convert informal mathematical proofs into formal Lean proofs.  In the first attachment I enclose an informally written proof that a certain equational law for magmas that we call Equation 1689 - the assertion that $x = (yx)((xz)z)$ for all $x,y,z$ in the magma - implies the singleton law $x=y$ (which we call Equation 2).  I managed to formalize this proof using a combination of automated tools, particularly GitHub Copilot and a new dependent type tactic `Canonical`, in which the informal proof was broken up into atomic sentence fragments that were placed into a Lean file as comments, together with the base definitions needed to formulate the problem, and then each fragment was formalized in a few lines of Lean code.  This formal proof is provided in the second attachment.

In the third attachment, I provide another informally written proof of the same implication.  I would like you to generate a Lean file that tries to formalize this proof into Lean to the extent that you are able to, in a format similar to that in the third attachment.  Thus, the output should be a Lean file with comments drawn from the informal proof, and each comment followed by a suitable translation into Lean. If you are uncertain as to how to formalize a given step, do the best u can, and add "sorry"s to any step that you were unable to formalize; I will then manually try to fill any sorries and fix any other issues.
